Hi ma'am. Wish you a very good morning. It's me Arpan Pal. 
The journey with Capgemini so far has been nothing short of thrilling and engaging. 
The training revealed the difference between the college studies and the corporate world. 
The level of competitiveness that the corporate world has, just makes us so much sound across all aspects, be it technical knowledge or communication skills or being a team member.
We'd have missed a whole lot of experience or exposure had this training not been there for us. This definitely seemed like a lot in the beginning. But we are getting a better hold of it after one and a half month or so.
Really excited to look forward to what more this training has to offer.
