Subject: Application for an emergency leave

Hello Jayashree,
 
This is me, Sarah, I've been working in your team for the last three weeks. Following up on our earlier discussion regarding my emergency leave, I am hereby writing this mail to you. As discussed, my grandfather just had an accident and he has been admitted to the local hospital in his city. At this moment of emergency there is none but me who can stay beside him. Therefore, I humbly request you to grant me a leave for 3 days starting from the coming Monday, the day after tomorrow. 
 
I plan to re-join the work from Thursday. I have informed my teammates about my situation that my work will not undergo during this time. Although I can be reached at any moment at the contact mentioned in the end of this mail.
 
I sincerely request you for an affirmative reply and grant me the leave which I am in an urgent need of.
 
With Regards,
 
Sarah Connor,
Assistant Trainee at Capgemini,
Kolkata, West Bengal, India.
