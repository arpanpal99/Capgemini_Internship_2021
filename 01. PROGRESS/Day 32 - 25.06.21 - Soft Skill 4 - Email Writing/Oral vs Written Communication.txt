1) In oral communication, we have to bringsforth the points one step at a time. Like mentioning one topic and give the other person a chance to speak about his perspective and then we should move on to the next topic. 
On the other hand, while communicating via emails or other texting platform, we have to be sum up everything we have to say and be very precise and maintain proper spacing between topics so that it doesn't feel like a research paper straight from MIT.

2) Oral communication, hence, is a much faster process because things get sorted up from both ends at that moment, which is not the case for written.

3) Written comm is necessary when we require to have paperworks or documentations or a valid proof of some message we send. While oral comm is not good for validation at a later point of time.

4) For oral comm, we have to prepare ourselves beforehand before delivering as we may miss a point while speaking among a group. That's not the case for written comm.
