Hello Jayashree,
This is me, Sarah, I've been working in "BU & Works" under your managership for the last six months. I am writing this email with reference to my remaining annual leave quota. Me and my family have been planning to go on a trip to Canada to one of our dearest relatives staying there. Thus, I humbly request you to grant me a leave from 24th of July to 2nd August, 2021. 
 
Currently, me and my team members are working on keeping the annual revenue data of Minnesota Mining Pvt. Ltd. Henry Goblin, my teammate has also agreed to take responsibility of any emergency task that might require my presence. If I'm allowed to take this leave, I can guarantee you that I can be reached at any moment at the contact mentioned in the end of this mail. 
 
I am humbly asking you to consider my leave request. I sincerely request you for an affirmative reply and grant me the leave which I am hoping to have in the upcoming month.
With Regards,
Sarah Connor,
Assistant Trainee at Capgemini,
Kolkata, West Bengal, India.

Process:
1.	I have to send an email to the manager mentioning the details.
2.	Then I can ask for a brief discussion sitting face-to-face and discuss if the manager agrees to grant me any leave.
