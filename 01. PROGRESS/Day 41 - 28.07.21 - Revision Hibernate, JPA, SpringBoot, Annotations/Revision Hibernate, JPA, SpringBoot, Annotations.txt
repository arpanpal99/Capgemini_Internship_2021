What is Hibernate?
What is ORM?
What is JPA?
How to integrate Hibernate in to spring boot?

Hibernate Version? Hibernate 5
What are the POM dependencies for creating a spring boot web application?
=> By default  it contains
     Spring-Boot-Parent
     Spring -boot-test
=> Spring Boot web

What are the POM dependencies for creating a spring boot  and hibernate web application?

=> By default  it contains
     Spring-Boot-Parent
     Spring -boot-test
=> Spring Boot web
=> Spring Data JPA

If I want to get new code automatically which depedency I want to add in the POM.xml file?

=> dev tools

Where to provide database and hibernate related details/configuration in spring boot application?
src/main/resources => application.properties 

What is @SpringBootApplication?
========================
Spring Boot @SpringBootApplication annotation is used to mark a configuration class that declares one or more @Bean methods and also triggers auto-configuration and component scanning. It's same as declaring a class with @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration and @ComponentScan annotations

What is the annotation used to mark a bean(class or interface) as Repository?
========================================================
@Repository 

What is the annotation used to mark a bean(class or interface) as service?
========================================================
@Service

What is the annotation used to inject dependency?
========================================================
@Autowired

What is dependency Injection?
=======================
Classes often require references to other classes. For example, a Car class might need a reference to an Engine class. These required classes are called dependencies, and in this example the Car class is dependent on having an instance of the Engine class to run.

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC(Inversion of Control). 
It allows the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and provides those objects to other class through different ways.

Types of Dependency Injection
======================
Constructor Injection
Property Injection
Method Injection

What is @RequestMapping?
===================
@RequestMapping. is one of the most common annotation used in Spring Web applications. This annotation maps HTTP requests to handler methods of MVC and REST controllers

What is the difference between @RequestMapping and @GetMapping?
====================================================
@RequestMapping is one of the most widely used Spring MVC annotation.
 org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping 
annotation is used to map web requests onto specific handler classes and/or handler methods.

@RequestMapping can be applied to the controller class as well as methods.
@GetMapping can be applied to the  methods for HTTP Get Requests.

What is @PathVariable annotation?
==========================
the @PathVariable annotation can be used to handle template variables in the request URI mapping, and set them as method parameters.

URL: http://localhost:8080/book/9783827319333

Now, to extract the value of ISBN number from the URI in your Spring Boot Controller's handler method, you can use @PathVariable annotation as shown in the following code:
@RequestMapping(value="/book/{ISBN}", method= RequestMethod.GET)
public String showBookDetails(@PathVariable("ISBN") String id,
                              Model model){
   model.addAttribute("ISBN", id);
   return "bookDetails";
}

What is @RequestParam annotation?
===========================
Using @RequestParam to get Query parameters
In a Spring Boot Web application, you can use the @RequestParam annotation to accept query parameters in Controller's handler methods.

For examples, suppose you have a web application that returns details of orders and trades, and you have the following URLs:

http://localhost:8080/eportal/orders?id=1001

To accept the query parameters in the above URLs, you can use the following code in the Spring Boot controller:
@RequestMapping("/orders")
public String showOrderDetails(@RequestParam("id") String orderId, Model model){
   model.addAttribute("orderId", orderId);
   return "orderDetails";
}

JPA Annotations
============
What is @Entity annotation?
====================
The @Entity annotation specifies that the class is an entity and is mapped to a database table.

What is @Id annotation?
====================
is used to specify a column as primary key

What is @Generation

What is @Column annotation?
======================
is used to specify column name to create in relation/table

What is @Table annotation?
======================
is used to specify table name to create in database

What is @NotBlank annotation?
=======================
   @NotBlank(message = "Email is mandatory")
    private String email;

What is @NotNull annotation?
======================
@NotNull. This says that value of variable/attribute/property can't be null in entity class 

Validations annotations in entity class
==========================
Constraint	Description
========================
@NotEmpty	Tests that the annotated element is not null nor empty
@Email		Tests that the specified character sequence is a well-formed email address
@Pattern		Tests that the annotated string matches the regular expression specified by the “regex” attribute
@Past		Test whether the annotated date is in the past

Is ID mandatory in Hibernate?
======================
Yes, hibernate requires an Id

What is the difference between JPA repository and CrudRepository?
==================================================
CrudRepository mainly provides CRUD functions. 
PagingAndSortingRepository provides methods to do pagination and sorting records. 
JpaRepository provides some JPA-related methods such as flushing the persistence context and deleting records in a batch and 
JpaRepository extends CrudRepository and PagingAndSortingRepository.

What is @RestController annotation in Spring boot?
=====================================
Spring RestController annotation is a convenience annotation that is itself annotated with @Controller and @ResponseBody .
This annotation is applied to a class to mark it as a request handler. 
Spring RestController annotation is used to create RESTful web services using Spring MVC and Spring Boot.

What is the difference between @component @repository @service and @controller?
==================================================================
@Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component or bean. 
@Repository is a stereotype for the persistence layer. 
@Service is a stereotype for the service layer. 
@Controller is a stereotype for the presentation layer (spring-MVC).
