		 * where it's useful to know if something went wrong 
		 * and what went wrong.
			Exit code is
			•0 when execution went fine;
			•1, -1, whatever != 0 
			when some error occurred, you can use different values 
			for different kind of errors
			The value you pass in, is just the exit code returned by the JVM 
			to the invoking operating system. 
			Usually 0 means no error and any non-zero
			value means that something happened 
			(where "something" is application specific).
			
			IT IS A BAD HABIT TO USE SYSTEM.EXIT 
			PROGRAM SHOULD EXIT NATURALLY
