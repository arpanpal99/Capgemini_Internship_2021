JDBC
====
Java DataBase Connectivity

Collections
========
Collection is an interface

all collections are defined under java.util

Set 
===
Set is an interface which extends collection interface
Set doesnot allow the duplicates
Set doesnot follow insertion order
Set allows null value

Implemented Classes of the Set
======================
HashSet => does not follow inserion order
LinkedHashSet =>Internally it used Doubly Linked List to store and manipulate the data
TreeSet => inserts the objects in natural order(lexograpically) ,because it has implement an extra interface called sorted set

What is difference between Collection and Array?
====================================
Array is used to store same type of data in sequential order
Array is static in size
Array has less perfomance than ArrayList
We can store primitive values like int,float,char etc., in the ArrayList

Collection  is used to store Objects of same type and different also
Collection is dynamic in size
Collection has better perfomance than Array
Collection  cannot store primitive values in the ArrayList

What is difference between Array and ArrayList?
=====================================
Array is used to store same type of data in sequential order
Array is static in size
Array has less perfomance than ArrayList
We can store primitive values like int,float,char etc., in the ArrayList

ArrayList is used to store object in sequential order using an Array
Arraylist is dynamic in size
ArrayList has better perfomance than Array
We cannot store primitive values in the ArrayList

What is difference between Vector and ArrayList?
===================================
similarites
=======
Vector and ArrayList uses Array internally as  data structure.
Both are dynamically resizeable

differences
========
only difference is how they are resized 
  => Vector doubles the size of its array when we add more elements
 => ArrayList increases by half of its size when we add more elements

ArrayList is have better performance than Vector?
why?
Because ArrayList methods are not synchornized but Vector methods are synchornized

What is synchronized or synchronization?
=============================
it prevents concurrent access of the code

class A{
     methodOne(){
}
     methodTwo(){
}
}

class A{
    synchronized methodOne(){ 
}
    synchronized methodTwo(){
}
}

What is difference between Comparator and Comparable?
==========================================
Comparable provides only one sorting sequence,i.e., we can only sort on id or name or price
Comparator provides multiple sorting sequences,i.e., we can sort the collection bases on different values

Comparable affects the original collection
comparators doesnot affect the original collection

compareTo() method is used to sort in Comparable  => Java.lang 
compare() method is used to sort elements in Comparator => java.util

Collections.sort(List)
Collections.sort(List,Comparator)

What is difference between Iterator and ListIterator ?
======================================
Iterator can be used only forward direction
ListIterator can be used in forward and backward direction

Scanner is the class to read the data from the keyboad.It is defined in java.util

nextInt(),nextFloat(),next(),nextLine() etc., are the methods of Scanner class to read different data types in java.


System.in => means to take input from the keyboard or user => input stream class reference variable
System.out => to print output to the console => print stream class reference variable

System is a class defined in java.lang package
in and out and err are reference variables in System

println statement in java is a method in Print Stream  class which is defined in java.io package

What is method in java?
=================
public void bankingOperations() { //method header or method signature 

//method body

//return statement
}

part in method header or method signature :
===============================
public => access specifier
void => return type
<method name> =>name of the method
() => parameter list

"Method is a piece code written inside the class to implement a task"

=====================================================================================

What is difference between HashSet and HashMap?
What is difference between HashTableand HashMap?
What is hashcode() method?
what is toString() method?
what is equals() method?
what is object class? and its methods?
what is lang package in java?
list some packages in java?
