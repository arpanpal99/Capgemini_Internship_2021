1.Write a Java Program to find where given number is strong number or not?
hint: 145 = 1! + 4! + 5! = 145

2.Write a Java Program to find where given number has duplicated digits or not?
	print the duplicate number?
hint: 144 = 4 is duplicated

3.Write a Java program to find whether give number is perfect or not?
hint : a positive integer equal to sum of proper divisors.
       6 = 1 + 2 + 3,28 = 1+2+7+4+14
4.Write a Java program to classify Abundant, deficient and perfect number (integers) between 1 to 10,000.
Hint : The integer 12 is the first abundant number. Its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 for a total of 16.
       divisors of 21 are 1, 3 and 7, and their sum is 11. Because 11 is less than 21, the number 21 is deficient. Its deficiency is 2 × 21 − 32 = 10.

5.Write a Java program to generate and show all Kaprekar numbers less than 1000.

8 Kaprekar numbers

6.Write a Java program to find the number of seed Lychrel number candidates and related numbers for n in the range 1..10000 inclusive. (With that iteration limit of 500). 
A Lychrel number is a natural number that cannot form a 
palindrome through the iterative process of repeatedly 
reversing its digits and adding the resulting numbers. 
This process is sometimes called the 196-algorithm, 
after the most famous number associated with the process.
The first few Lychrel numbers are 196, 295, 394, 493, 592, 689, 691, 788, 790, 879, 887, ... .
Expected Output :
5 Lychrel seeds: [196, 879, 1997, 7059, 9999]
244 Lychrel related
5 Lychrel palindromes: [196, 879, 1997, 7059, 9999]

7.Write a Java program to display first 10 lucus numbers.
The Lucas numbers or series are an integer sequence named after 
the mathematician François Édouard Anatole Lucas, 
who studied both that sequence and the closely related Fibonacci numbers. 
Lucas numbers and Fibonacci numbers form complementary instances of Lucas sequences.
The sequence of Lucas numbers is: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, ….
Expected Output :

   First ten Lucas a numbers:                                              
2                                                                       
1                                                                       
3                                                                       
4                                                                       
7                                                                       
11                                                                      
18                                                                      
29                                                                      
47

8. Write a Java program to find and print the first 10 happy numbers.
Happy number: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number 
by the sum of the squares of its digits, and 
repeat the process until the number equals 1, 
or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Example: 19 is a happy number
12 + 92=82
82 + 22=68
62 + 82=100
12 + 02 + 02=1

Expected Output

First 10 Happy numbers:                                                 
1                                                                       
7                                                                       
10                                                                      
13                                                                      
19                                                                      
23                                                                      
28

9. 11. Write a Java program to check 
whether a given number is a Disarium number or unhappy number.
A Disarium number is a number defined by the following process :
Sum of its digits powered with their respective position is equal to the original number.
For example 175 is a Disarium number :
As 11+32+53 = 135
Some other DISARIUM are 89, 175, 518 etc.
A number will be called Disarium if the sum of its digits powered with their respective position 
is equal with the number itself. 
Sample Input: 135.
Expected Output

Input a number : 25                                                     
Not a Disarium Number.

10.  Write a Java program to check whether a number is a Harshad Number or not.
In recreational mathematics, a harshad number in a given number base, 
is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits when written in that base.
Example: Number 200 is a Harshad Number 
because the sum of digits 2 and 0 and 0 is 2(2+0+0) and 200 is divisible by 2. 
Number 171 is a Harshad Number because the sum of digits 1 and 7 and 1 is 9(1+7+1) 
and 171 is divisible by 9.
Expected Output

Input a number : 353  
                                                  
353 is not a Harshad Number.
